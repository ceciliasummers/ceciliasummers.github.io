## About me
I am starting as an assistant professor at University of Victoria in 2022, teaching and doing research on deep learning.
My research seeks to discover *how* deep learning works, experimentally discovering insights that improve our understanding and lead to practical improvements that advance the field.


I completed my PhD from the University of Auckland in 2021, and along the way also interned at Apple doing natural language processing.

## Potential Students
I am recruiting PhD students to work with me and do deep learning-related research in my lab.
Ideal applicants have already done some amount of research in deep learning, computer vision, or another field related to machine learning, with at least one publication in a top conference (ICLR, ICML, NeurIPS, CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, WACV, etc.).
If you are interested, please [contact me](mailto:ceciliasummers@uvic.ca).
