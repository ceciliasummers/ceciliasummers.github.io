## About me
I started as an assistant professor (tenure-track) at University of Victoria, Canada in 2022, teaching and doing research on deep learning.
My research seeks to discover *how* deep learning works, experimentally discovering insights that improve our understanding and lead to practical improvements that advance the field.

## Education
I completed my PhD in Computer Science from the University of Auckland (New Zealand) and was nominated for the Dean’s List award (top 5% of the year). I also hold an MS in Applied Mathematics and graduated with a Distinction Award for my Master’s Thesis (top two in the department). Along the way also interned at Apple doing natural language processing.

## Recent Publications
You can find the full list of my work on deep learning here: [Google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9h2gGfoAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).
